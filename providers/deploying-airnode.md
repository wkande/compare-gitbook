# Deploying Airnode

After [integrating your API](/provider-guides/api-integration.md) and [creating the configuration files](/provider-guides/configuring-airnode.md), the next step is to deploy your Airnode. Airnode comes with a [deployer](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/master/packages/deployer), which uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to automate the entire deployment process. This deployer is also containerized as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image, which allows you to deploy your Airnode on any platform without worrying about installing dependencies. So let's begin!
